## üß† Project Overview

This technical report is divided into two main analytical sections:

### **1. Cardiovascular Disease in England (50%)**

- **Objective:** Identify which factors (overweight, poverty, smoking, and wellbeing) are statistically associated with the prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) across local authority regions in England.
- **Methods:** Linear regression, effect size estimation, model checking, and visualisation
- **Deliverables:**
  - Professional statistical reporting using NHST and estimation
  - A clean, publication-ready visualisation showing the effect of **poverty** on **CVD prevalence**
  - Plain-English interpretation of findings

### **2. Customer Satisfaction in Retail (50%)**

- **Objective:** Investigate the influence of delivery time, staff satisfaction, new product range, and store socio-economic-status (SES) on **customer satisfaction** across furniture retail stores.
- **Special focus:** Understand whether the **impact of delivery time** on satisfaction differs across **high**, **medium**, and **low SES** stores.
- **Methods:** Multiple linear regression with interaction terms, confidence intervals, and visual diagnostics
- **Deliverables:**
  - Statistical output adhering to reporting standards
  - An interaction plot visualising how delivery time influences satisfaction across SES groups
  - Business-friendly conclusions derived from statistical evidence
